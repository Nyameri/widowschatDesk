<p>by empowering the widows with knowledge
and skills ,by providing them with the resources
they need to be economically independent,by educating
 them on their health and their human rights,we are removing 
that' vulnerability factor'women face when their
husbands die.
we are equipping them with the means to contribute
equally to the sustainability of our society</p>

<p>2
 CONSIDER DIALOGUE 4 JESUS are into creating opportunities for the
widows,sending a message that the days of social
exclusion and discrimination of the widows are over
she belongs alongside every member of our society
 contributing her quota to development.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>JESUS IS THE ANSWER to our soul 
nourishment for eschatological
empowerment and  as we abide to the bibles teachings
of James 1:27 we end making the widows rather than feel 
excluded have an assurance that the society as a whole
 caters for and has the interest of them as a priority
on the day in day out callender of the community
to make the potential in them achievable and the end
result of a society that follows the teachings of the
bible and what Jesus said about loving a neighbor</p>

<p>4</p>

<p><a href="http://www.empowermentforwidows.org/">www.empowermentforwidows.org/</a> and widows development
organization,international arena for mutual idea of 
capacity developing so that the end~user who is the widow
ends up armed with know how skills and enlightenment on 
economical matters to sustainablly live and educate the 
children she has and not end in an atrophy situation
which the in~laws tend to wish on her for no good reason.
once we achieve these objectives within the parameters set 
and well wishers support our mission will be half way
achieved though the full mission is a contunity process
as the widow needs to be spiritually nurtured so that
she may develop good communal trends rather than be 
marooned on an island of 'not knowing what to do,expect
or whom to consult in case of an urgency</p>

<p>5
i personally appeal to all well wishers to consider the 
initiative and through moral,material and spiritual support
we achieve these set goals that are condusive to society et al</p>

<p>6
      'Educate a woman,you educate a nation,
      Empower a widow,you empower a virtue'
to educate the mind is to liberate it from shackles
of fear,prejudice,ignorance,superstitution etc.
to empower a widow is to enduce the virtue of being
compassionate to humanity
The degree of widow~hood rites imposed depend on:
age,level of education,parity status (with children
or barren)nature of relationship with husband and in
~laws,cause of husbands death,widows occupation and 
mutual respect &amp; cohesiveness among family members</p>

<p>Education/civilization has been forefront in eroding
pervasive widow~hood rites.widows are dis~empowered,
 mal~treated and exposed to other injustices not
experienced by widowers.
evidently,women who have little or no education do 
not question tradition.
the gravity depends on widows social and personal 
attributes</p>

WORK WITH THEM;BUILD ON WHAT THEY HAVE
BUT OF THE BEST LEADERS,WHEN THE TASK IS
ACCOMPLISHED,THE WORK COMPLETED,

WE'VE DONE IT OURSELVES  ----lao tsu</p>

<p>THEY WANTED TO ALLEVIATE POVERTY
mca's of nyamira,a comfortable county,took a goodwill
tour and visited a low~income village.
they returned with the idea that the people of their
county could help to alleviate poverty.
slides of what they had seen were shown and a need
identified.so the campaign started.
6 months later after help was sent a follow~up
was made but not much was done.
after inquiring was told such scheme alleviates poverty
and does not do what was intended,so sustainability
has to be the emphasis</p>
